![Create sitemaps with Sitemapa](https://abstractkitchen.com/static/assets/flask-backbone-boilerplate.jpg "Flask-Backbone")

## Features
- Predefined basic structure, so you'll end up with a clean architecture.
- Database support via **SQLAlchemy**. However, you can skip database setup and use Flask-Backbone without the database. I also do not use Flask-SQLAlchemy, but you can.
- **Alembic** for your database migrations.
- Development/Production/You own configs with **instance_relative_config**.
- Cache support via **flask_caching**. Setup easily with configuration.
- **Flask-Debug**
- **Sentry** support. Just add your DSN, and you're good to go.
- **Jinja** filters and custom variables.
- Designed to be **blueprint-first**. Keep your structure clean and steady with blueprints. Everything is a blueprint. Your future self will thank you.
- Interactive commands to create your next blueprint. Define your blueprint skeletons to speed up your development. To create your next blueprint simply run flask app create-blueprint. It's up to you and you can completely ignore or remove this part and everything will work perfectly fine.
- Initial setup with a configuration script.
- WSGI config
